# Gap log (handoff `issues.md`)

Two kinds (`1_contract.md` §6): **setup difference** (names the targets it affects) and **implementation gap**
(measured, target, suspected cause).

## Design difference: mHC boundary at the stage edge (M2/M3)

- The targets price the first layer of stages 1–3 with the fused `attn_mhc_post_pre` (DeepGEMM mega), while the send
  carries only the 4-stream residual (32 KiB per token). A fused post+pre on the receiver needs the previous layer's
  `x`, `post` and `comb`, which that send does not carry.
- pp-impl applies the deferred `hc_post` (TileLang) on the sender and runs a standalone `hc_pre` (TileLang) on the
  receiver. From the targets' own rows: +0.092 − 0.062 = +0.030 ms per edge at 8k, +1.307 − 0.986 = +0.32 ms at 128k
  (< 0.06% of a stage). Sending `x`/`post`/`comb` too (~40 KiB per token) would add ~25% to every send instead.

## Target over-count: router `gate_recompute` (M2/M3)

- The targets price two router GEMMs per MoE layer (`gate` + `gate_recompute`, `gemm_fp32_output` n=288). The fork at
  `892da0822f` runs the router once (commit 1768273c13, "no duplicate router GEMM"), and pp-impl keeps one.
- Effect: real is faster than the target by one router GEMM per MoE layer (42 MoE layers). Per-stage size at M2.

## Design difference: output head on the returned rows only (M2/M3)

- The targets price `final_mhc_post` and `hc_contract_mean` on all T tokens (and `final_norm` at m = T in the cost
  tree). Both are per token and only the `is_last` rows reach `lm_head`, so pp-impl selects those rows first and runs
  the final `hc_post`, the stream mean, the norm and `lm_head` on them (layer 44 defers its final post to the head).
- Effect: `output_head` is faster than the target by ~0.14 ms at 8k and ~2.4 ms at 128k (stage 3 only).

## Implementation choice: KDA metadata without vLLM's GDN builder (M2/M3)

- `Glm5NextLinearAttention._forward` is replaced (Dao conv + FlashInfer persistent KDA, configs 4/5), so the GDN
  metadata builder that only that method reads is not run. Our `KdaPrefillMeta` carries the sequences, state blocks
  and the FlashInfer work plan (built once per distinct sequence offsets on a side stream: FlashInfer's
  `recurrent_kda` wrapper calls `cu_seqlens.tolist()`, a host sync, so pp-impl calls the persistent `fwd` directly).
- Glue the targets do not price: q/k/v are made contiguous for FlashInfer (3 copies of [T, 8192] BF16) and beta
  (one small copy). Measured at M2 under position `null` in `measured/layers.jsonl`.
